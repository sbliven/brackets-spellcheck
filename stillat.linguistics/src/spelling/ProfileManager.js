/**
 * The ProfileManager is responsible for loading dictionary profiles. A dictionary profile
 * is essentially just a list of known dictionaries, and doesn't contribute anything to
 * the logic/processing of determining if words are incorrect, or their suggestions.
 * 
 * The ProfileManager module should be considered a "private module" and should not be called
 * directly. It is used internally by the DictionaryManager to "merge" the loaded dictionaries
 * and the custom user profiles. Each natural language will have it's own profile by profile
 * entry by default (this is because the new spell checking system now only considers profiles
 * as valid "dictionaries"). See the "check" and "suggest" methods in DictionaryManager for
 * more implementation details.
 * 
 * Most of the functions exposed by this module are considered "safe" in that they will ensure
 * that the ProfileManager has been properly initialized before doing any checks or data
 * retrieval.
 * 
 * For example, someone could create their own Australian English dictionary that loads
 * both an "en_AU" dictionary as well as a medical terminology dictionary. This might
 * look like this:
 * 
 * "my_en": [
 *    { type: "dictionary", "en_AU" },
 *    { type: "dictionary", "medical_terms" }
 * ]
 * 
 * Both "en_UA" and "medical_terms" would be expected to be a valid dictionaries that have
 * been installed in the "natural-languages" directory within the Linguistics dictionary
 * extension (note that the "type" property must have a value of "dictionary" to be able
 * to load dictionaries from the natural languages directory).
 * 
 * Special note on the user dictionary: The user dictionary will be loaded regardless of the
 * profile that is loaded.
 * 
 * Profile entry "type":
 * 
 *     - "dictionary"
 *           Loads a dictionary from the "natural-languages" directory.
 *     - "utility"
 *           Loads an ignore file from the "generic-utilities" directory.
 *     - "programming"
 *           Foreceully loads an ignore file from the "programming-languages" directory. Linguistics
 *           attempts to automatically load these files based on the current editor's context.
 * 
 * This module dispatches a few events:
 * 
 * 
 *    - userProfilesLoaded -- When the list of user profiles had loaded.
 *          (e, availableProfiles::array)
